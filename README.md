# nimiq-vanity-miner
A native miner for Nimiq vanity addresses.

## Installation (Linux/macOS)
The code does not have to be installed.
Just clone the repository and compile it.

```
git clone https://github.com/paberr/nimiq-vanity-miner.git
cd nimiq-vanity-miner
make
```

## Usage
`Usage: vanity_generate prefix [max_rounds] [--exact-match]`

There are three command line arguments you can pass to `vanity_generate`:

1. `prefix`: This argument is non-optional and defines the prefix your address should have.
Important: The longer the prefix, the longer it takes until an address is found.
2. `max_rounds`: Using this option, you can limit the number of tries the program makes before giving up.
3. `--exact-match`: By default, the program uses a mapping (see below) to find similar prefixes. If you activate this option, the program accepts only an exact match of the prefix.

## Mapping
By default, the program uses a mapping to represent missing or similar characters in the adress alphabet.
A Nimiq address consists of only the following characters: `0123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVXY`.
The program then maps the numbers 0 to 7 to its closest letters in order to find similar matches.
The mapping is as follows:

- 0 -> O
- 1 -> I
- 2 -> Z
- 3 -> E
- 4 -> A
- 5 -> S
- 6 -> G
- 7 -> T

That means that searching for the prefix `TEST` will also match addresses like `7E5T`.
